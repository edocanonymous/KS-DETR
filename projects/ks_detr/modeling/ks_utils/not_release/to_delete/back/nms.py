    """Fast NMS in `YOLACT <https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689>`_.

    Fast NMS allows already-removed detections to suppress other detections so
    that every instance can be decided to be kept or discarded in parallel,
    which is not possible in traditional NMS. This relaxation allows us to
    implement Fast NMS entirely in standard GPU-accelerated matrix operations.

    Args:
        multi_bboxes (Tensor): shape (n, #class*4) or (n, 4)
        multi_scores (Tensor): shape (n, #class+1), where the last column
            contains scores of the background class, but this will be ignored.
        multi_coeffs (Tensor): shape (n, #class*coeffs_dim).
        score_thr (float): bbox threshold, bboxes with scores lower than it
            will not be considered.
        iou_thr (float): IoU threshold to be considered as conflicted.
        top_k (int): if there are more than top_k bboxes before NMS,
            only top top_k will be kept.
        max_num (int): if there are more than max_num bboxes after NMS,
            only top max_num will be kept. If -1, keep all the bboxes.
            Default: -1.

    Returns:
        tuple: (dets, labels, coefficients), tensors of shape (k, 5), (k, 1),
            and (k, coeffs_dim). Dets are boxes with scores.
            Labels are 0-based.
