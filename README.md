## Acknowledgement
- Our code is built on detrex, which is an open-source toolbox for Transformer-based detection algorithms created by researchers of **IDEACVR**. 

- detrex is built based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) and part of its module design is borrowed from [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [DETR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), and [Deformable-DETR](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR).
